# Visual-Question-Answering

We implemented this VQA project using baseline methods (ResNet + LSTM) and the advanced methods (Stacked Attention Model). We trained our model on a relative small dataset for flexibility. For details, please check the final report. We implemented the work in Fall 2018 and refined the pipeline and code in Spring 2019.

Here is the final accuracy table for comparison.
